R/a/dio - https://r-a-d.io
==========================

R/a/dio's site, open-sourced. This is a heavy work in progress.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/R-a-dio/radio.site.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/R-a-dio/radio.site)


Why? I thought you were doing it in python?
------------------------------------------

We've been "doing it in python" for over a year now. The current implementation is pretty shockingly coded (but hey, it works), and a few decisions for the site were "interesting" (read: horribly insecure if the code was open-sourced), so we've never had it on github.

So [@hirotothefish](https://twitter.com/hirotothefish) (Hiroto) decided to completely redo the site from scratch.

Libraries
---------

The site backend is built on Laravel.

The HTML/CSS/JS side of things has a bunch of libraries:

- Bootstrap3
- History.js
- Ajaxify.js
- jQuery ScrollTo
- jQuery (of course)

tl;dr of these is that they make two very important things (music playing while browsing รก la SoundCloud, and the actual design) really bloody easy.

Alpha + Beta
----

The staging area (beta) for changes due for live is at https://r-a-d.io/beta/

The development area (unstable, will often be a 500 error) is at https://r-a-d.io/dev/public/


Issues
------

Create an issue here if you experience problems with the site when it has launched (until then, keep them to critical-looking bugs in the beta site).

To contact the dev(s), ping Hiroto on IRC (#R/a/dio @ irc.rizon.net) or on Twitter [@hirotothefish](https://twitter.com/hirotothefish)
